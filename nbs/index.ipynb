    "> JAX-compatible triangular meshes and triangular-mesh-based simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This package provides data-structures for triangular meshes and geometry processing tools based on JAX and fully compatible with JAX's just-in-time compilation and automatic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Triangular meshes are ubiquitous in computer graphics and in scientific computing. The tools provided by `triangulax` makes it easy to implement custom geometry processing operations (in familiar python). But the main feature of `triangulax` is compatibility with automatic differentiation. Why? Often, one is often interested in deforming/dynamical meshes. For example:\n",
    "1. Flattening or deforming 3D models (computer graphics)\n",
    "2. Simulating thin plates or membranes (mechanics) \n",
    "\n",
    "This usually requires optimizing some mesh-based \"energy\" (like the [Helfrich energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_of_cell_membranes) in membrane elasticity, or the [Dirichlet energy](https://multires.caltech.edu/pubs/ConfEquiv.pdf) in mesh parametrization). Automatic differentiation makes is trivial to compute gradients and optimize such energies, and rapidly explore different ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use case is as a simulation framework for 2D tissue mechanics ([Active tension networks](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2321928121), [area-perimeter vertex model](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.021011), [active foams](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01215-1)). 2D cell tilings are conveniently represented by their dual triangular network.\n",
    "`triangulax` makes it easy to implement various models, and JAX makes it trivial to compute the resulting forces, and run simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient-based \"meta-optimization\"\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can go further: once we have written a dynamical model for triangular meshes, thanks to JAX, we can _differentiate_ the model output w.r.t. model parameters. We can then use gradient-based optimization to find dynamical models that produce certain behaviors of interest. For example, in the tissue mechanics context you could ask: what mechanical actions do individual cells need to take so that the tissue as a whole takes on a certain shape?\n"
