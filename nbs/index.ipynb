    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This python package provides data-structures for triangular meshes and geometry processing tools based on JAX and fully compatible with JAX's just-in-time compilation and automatic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Triangular meshes are ubiquitous in computer graphics and in scientific computing. The tools provided by `triangulax` makes it easy to implement custom geometry processing operations (and in Python, rather than C++). `triangulax` complements libraries like the excellent [`libigl` python bindings](https://libigl.github.io/libigl-python-bindings/) focused on providing \"ready made\" geometry processing tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main feature of `triangulax` is compatibility with automatic differentiation. This enables computation of gradients of any mesh-based function. Most tools are also compatible with JAX's JIT-compilation, delivering high performance in high-level python.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flattening or deforming 3D models (computer graphics)\n",
    "2. Simulating thin plates or membranes (mechanics) \n",
    "\n",
    "Such tasks often require optimizing some mesh-based \"energy\" (like the [Helfrich elastic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_of_cell_membranes), or the [Dirichlet energy](https://multires.caltech.edu/pubs/ConfEquiv.pdf)). Automatic differentiation makes is trivial to compute gradients and optimize such energies, and rapidly explore different ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use case is as a simulation framework for 2D tissue mechanics ([Active tension networks](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2321928121), [area-perimeter vertex model](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.021011), [active foams](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01215-1)). 2D cell tilings are conveniently represented by their dual triangular network.\n",
    "`triangulax` makes it easy to implement various models, and JAX makes it trivial to compute the resulting forces, and run simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient-based \"meta-optimization\" and inverse problems\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can go further: once we have written a dynamical model for triangular meshes, thanks to JAX, we can _differentiate_ the model output w.r.t. model parameters. This means we can apply gradient-based optimization to _inverse problems_. For example, in the tissue mechanics context you could ask: what mechanical actions do individual cells need to take so that the tissue as a whole takes on a certain shape?"
