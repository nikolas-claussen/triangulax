    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This python package provides data-structures for triangular meshes and geometry processing tools based on JAX and fully compatible with JAX's just-in-time compilation and automatic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Triangular meshes are ubiquitous in computer graphics and in scientific computing. The tools provided by `triangulax` makes it easy to implement custom geometry processing operations (and in Python, rather than C++). `triangulax` complements libraries like the excellent [`libigl` python bindings](https://libigl.github.io/libigl-python-bindings/) focused on providing \"ready made\" geometry processing tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second use case is simulating for 2D tissue mechanics ([Active tension networks](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2321928121), [area-perimeter vertex model](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.021011), [active foams](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-021-01215-1)). 2D cell tilings are conveniently represented by their dual triangular network.\n",
    "`triangulax` makes it (relatively) easy to implement custom models within a single libary. JAX makes it easy to compute mechanical forces from arbitrary energy functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main feature of `triangulax` is compatibility with automatic differentiation. This enables computation of gradients of any mesh-based function. Most tools are also compatible with JAX's JIT-compilation, delivering high performance in high-level python.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flattening or deforming 3D models (computer graphics)\n",
    "2. Mechanics of thin plates or membranes (mechanics) \n",
    "3. Cell resolved tissue simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Such tasks often feature some mesh-based \"energy\" (like the [Dirichlet variational functional](https://multires.caltech.edu/pubs/ConfEquiv.pdf), the [Helfrich elastic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_of_cell_membranes), or the [Dirichlet functional](https://multires.caltech.edu/pubs/ConfEquiv.pdf), or the [area-perimeter energy](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.021011), respectively). Automatic differentiation with JAX makes is trivial to compute gradients. \n",
    "This makes it easy to optimize energies or to simulate forces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gradient-based \"meta-optimization\" and inverse problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation goes further: once we have a dynamical model for triangular meshes, we can _differentiate_ the model output w.r.t. its parameters. This means one can apply gradient-based optimization to _inverse problems_. For example, in the tissue mechanics context: what mechanical actions do individual cells need to take so that the tissue as a whole takes on a certain shape?"
