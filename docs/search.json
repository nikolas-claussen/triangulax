    "text": "JAX-compatible data structure triangulations\nFirst, we need to create a suitable data structure to describe cell arrays. We will represent cell tilings by 2D Voronoi tessellations and variants thereof (like power diagrams). Cells are denoted by Latin indices \\(i,j,k, \\dots\\). Voronoi tessellations are dual to Delaunay triangulations (each Voronoi vertex is a Delaunay triangle). This means that we can represent the cell network as a 2D triangulation with vertices \\(V\\) and faces \\(F\\). Each face is an (ordered) triple of vertices \\((i,j,k)\\). Vertex positions are denoted \\(\\mathbf{v}_i\\).\nWe will first consider the case where the number of vertices does not change. Cells can, however, rearrange (T1-transitions/edge flips in the triangulation). Such flips also conserve the number of faces and edges. In addition to the vertices and faces, we will need to store various attributes for vertices, faces, and edges (for example, the edge lengths, or the Voronoi position of a face).\n\nCoding style notes\nThroughout, we will (attempt to) provide a type signature for all functions. To do so for array-based functions, we use jaxtyping.\n\n\nJAX\nThe aim is to create a triangulation datastructure compatible with the JAX library for automatic differentiation and numerical computing. In practice, this means that we use jnp (=jax.numpy) instead of numpy, and make sure our code follows JAX’s functional programming paradigm (see JAX- the sharp bits). There is also some extra legwork to register any new classes with JAX.\n\n\nBasic trigonometry\nFor example, the circumcenter of a triangle, which is the position of the dual Voronoi vertex.\n\nsource\n\n\nget_rot_mat\n\ndef get_rot_mat(\n    theta:float\n)-&gt;Float[Array, '2 2']:\n\nGet rotation matrix from angle in radians.\n\nsource\n\n\nget_angle_between_vectors\n\ndef get_angle_between_vectors(\n    a:Float[Array, 'dim'], b:Float[Array, 'dim']\n)-&gt;Float[Array, '']:\n\nAngle between two vectors\n\nsource\n\n\nget_voronoi_corner_area\n\ndef get_voronoi_corner_area(\n    a:Float[Array, '2'], b:Float[Array, '2'], c:Float[Array, '2'], epsilon:float=1e-06\n)-&gt;Float[Array, '']:\n\nCompute Voronoi area at corner a of triangle abc.

Triangles will be denoted as faces. We thus represent a cell tiling by:\n\nA set of vertices, i.e., a \\((N_V, 2)\\) dimensional array datatype float.\nA set of faces, a \\((N_F, 3)\\) dimensional array of datatype int. Each row is a triple of vertex indices that form a face.\nA set of face positions, a \\((N_F, 2)\\) dimensional array of datatype float. An entry is the position of the tesselation vertex dual to the triangulation face.\n\nTo read and write, we use the .obj-file format. We will also make heavy use of the igl geometry processing library. We start by defining a minimal TriMesh class for our cell-tiling objects. This class is mainly a “holder” class for loading, saving, visualizing, etc meshes, and not to be used for numerical computation. We come to that below.\nFurther below, we will also add optional attributes for faces, vertices, and edges. Each attribute is a dictionary with keys (from an Enum of possibilities) and values, which are numpy vectors whose \\(n\\)th entry corresponds to vertex/face/edge \\(n\\). For this reason, vertices/faces/edges are ordered.\n\nsource\n\n\nTriMesh\n\ndef TriMesh(\n    vertices:Float[Array, 'n_vertices dim'], faces:Int[Array, 'n_faces 3'], face_positions:Union=None\n)-&gt;None:\n\nSimple class for reading, holding, transforming, and saving triangular meshes.\nA TriMesh comprises vertices and faces, describing a surface in 2d or 3d. In addition, there can be a 2d/3d position for every face (think Voronoi dual of the triangulation).\nVertices and faces are jnp.arrays. Each face is a triple of vertex indices. Vertices and faces are ordered - this is essential so that we know which attribute vector entry goes to which vector/edge/face. Faces in a face are assumed to be in counter-clockwise order.\nMeshes are read and written in the .obj format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file). To store face_positions, we abuse the vn (vertex normal) entry of an .obj file. Face positions will be written in order corresponding to faces. When reading from an .obj file, edges are recomputed from faces and initialized in alpha-numerical ordering. An .obj file expects 3d positions; the z-position is ignored when reading and set to 0 when writing for 2d meshes.\nAttributes\ndim : int = 2\nvertices : Float[jax.Array, “n_vertices dim”]\nfaces : Int[jax.Array, “n_faces 3”]\nface_positions : Float[jax.Array, “n_faces dim”]\nProperty methods (use like attributes)\nn_vertices : int\nhas_inf_vertex : bool\nStatic methods\nread_obj : str -&gt; TriMesh\nMethods\nwrite_obj : str -&gt; None\n\n# test reading a mesh\nmesh = TriMesh.read_obj(\"test_meshes/disk.obj\")\n\nWarning: readOBJ() ignored non-comment line 3:\n  o flat_tri_ecmc\n\n\n\n# test computing the circumcenter of each face. should be equidistant to all vertex points\n\ndists = jnp.stack([jnp.linalg.norm(mesh.vertices[mesh.faces[:,i]]-mesh.face_positions, axis=1) for i in [0,1,2]], axis=1)\n\njnp.allclose(dists[:,0], dists[:,1]) and jnp.allclose(dists[:,1], dists[:,2])\n\nArray(True, dtype=bool)\n\n\n\n# test writing face positions to vn entries\n\nmesh = TriMesh.read_obj(\"test_meshes/disk.obj\")\nfilename = \"test_meshes/disk_write_test.obj\"\nmesh.write_obj(filename, save_face_positions=True)\nmesh = TriMesh.read_obj(filename, read_face_positions=True)\n\nWarning: readOBJ() ignored non-comment line 3:\n  o flat_tri_ecmc\n\n\n\n\nCreating meshes and plotting\nSome functions to create meshes based on the Delaunay triangulation of a point set.\n\nPoisson (vertices placed uniformly at random) in disk or box\nGinibre (vertices placed at uniform with self-repulsion)\nTriangular lattice\n\nSome functions for plotting meshes:\n\nPlot triangulation with vertex and face labels (for debugging)\nPlot cell tesselation\n\n\nsource\n\n\ngenerate_triangular_lattice\n\ndef generate_triangular_lattice(\n    nx:int, ny:int\n)-&gt;Float[Array, 'nx*ny 2']:\n\nGet points for rectangular patch of triangular lattice with nx, ny points.\n\nsource\n\n\ngenerate_poisson_points\n\ndef generate_poisson_points(\n    n_vertices:int, limit_x:float=1, limit_y:float=1\n)-&gt;Float[Array, 'n_vertices 2']:\n\nSample n_vertices points from the Poisson ensemble in rectangle [-limit_x/2, limit_x/2] * [-limit_y/2, limit_y/2].\n\nsource\n\n\ngenerate_ginibre_points\n\ndef generate_ginibre_points(\n    n_vertices:int\n)-&gt;Float[Array, 'n_vertices 2']:\n\nSample n_vertices points from the Ginibre ensemble.

    "text": "Half-edge meshes\nFor simulation and geometry processing, we need a different representation of the adjacency information than the list of triangle (for example, to compute the area of a cell). Typically, this is achieved by a half-edge mesh (HE) data structure.

(Not to be confused with the \\((N_F, 3)\\) matrix of vertex IDs used previously).\n\nAdditionally, there are two float arrays for vertex and face positions, as previously. However, we split combinatorial and geometric information - a HeMesh class for the combinatorics, and a couple of regular arrays for the vertex positions, face positions, and vertex/half-edge/face attributes. The latter are packaged into a GeomMesh class. Together, the pair (GeomMesh, HeMesh) describes a mesh (like vertices/faces pair). A named tuple Mesh comines the two.\nThe first task is to create a helper function to plot mesh connectivity, and to create the half-edge connectivity matrices from the more conventional list-of-triangles format. The latter is somewhat involved.\n\nsource\n\nlabel_plot\n\ndef label_plot(\n    vertices:Float[Array, 'n_vertices 2'], faces:Int[Array, 'n_faces 3'], hemesh:Union=None, vertex_labels:bool=True,\n    face_labels:bool=True, ax:Union=None, fontsize:Union=None\n)-&gt;None:\n\nFor debugging purposes.

For this reason, we\n\nAlways use jnp = jax.numpy instead of np\nInstead of in-place array modifications, use JAX’s x = x.at[idx].set(y) syntax\nAvoid any in-place modifications in the HeMesh and GeomHeMesh data structures\nRegister our (data)classes with JAX, so JAX knows how to handle them during gradient-computation and just-in-time compilation. See here and here. This involves declaring which parts are mutable and which parts are permanent.\n\nLateron, for simulations, we use the equinox library, which adds a few useful tools to JAX. (A neural-network library like flax is probably overkill).\n\nPyTrees\nJAX supports not only arrays as inputs/outputs/intermediate variables, but also pytrees. Pytrees are nested structures (dicts, lists-of-lists, etc) whose leaves are “elementary” objects like arrays. Fortunately, our HeMesh class is already a lot like a pytree - it is a collection of arrays. For JAX to understand this, we need to register our HeMesh class as a custom pytree node. We register our dataclasses using jax.tree_util.register_dataclass.\nSidenote: Neural networks, in libraries like Flax or Equinox, are basically very similar. They are dataclass-like classes which hold all the arrays associated with a NN (the different weights, and maybe some parameters) with class methods like __call__ specifying the forward pass through the NN. Equinox automatically registers your NN as a pytree by inheriting from the equinox.Module class.\n\n\nControl flow\nFor just-in-time compilation, JAX distinguishes two types of variables: dynamic and static. Control flow cannot depend on the value of dynamic variables, only on their shape.\nUpshots: 1. replace if with jax.lax.cond / jnp.where (full autodiff compatible), and while with jax.lax.while_loop (forward autodiff only). 2. mark variables which are not going to change during simulation as static.\n\nsource\n\n\n\nHeMesh\n\ndef HeMesh(\n    incident:Int[Array, '*batch n_vertices'], orig:Int[Array, '*batch n_hes'], dest:Int[Array, '*batch n_hes'],\n    twin:Int[Array, '*batch n_hes'], nxt:Int[Array, '*batch n_hes'], prv:Int[Array, '*batch n_hes'],\n    heface:Int[Array, '*batch n_hes'], face_incident:Int[Array, '*batch n_faces'], inf_vertices:Union=()\n)-&gt;None:\n\nHalf-edge mesh data structure for triangular meshes.\nA half-edge mesh is described by a set of half-edges and several arrays that specify their connectivity (see markup explanation above). This class serves as a container for multiple arrays. For future compatibility with JAX, after initialization, do not modify these arrays in-place; always return a new HeMesh object. The mesh vertices may live in whatever dimension - this does not affect the connectivity bookkeeping.\nHalf-edge meshes are initialized from a list of triangles and a number of vertices, and can return the original triangles (e.g., to save as a .obj).\nAll information and methods are purely “combinatorial”. The HeMesh class does not contain the vertex or face positions. These are saved in the GeomHeMesh class that combines a HeMesh (combinatorics) with a couple of other arrays (geometry).\n—Conventions—\nFor vertices, the incident half-edge points away from the vertex.\nTo describe the mesh boundary, there are two options: 1. Initialize from a triangulation with a boundary. Half-edges without a face (boundary) are assigned heface=-1. 2. Initialize from a triangulation without boundary, where certain vertices are “at infinity”. They should have coordinates [np.inf, np.inf]. Each infinity vertex corresponds to one boundary. For a single boundary, the vertex at infinity is, by convention, the final one.\nStarting from a set of triangles, the half-edges are initialized as follows: The 1st N_edges half-edges are (origin_vertex, destination_vertex), in lexicographic order, with origin_vertex &lt; destination_vertex. The 2nd N_edges are their twins, in the same order.\nAttributes\nincident : Int[jax.Array, “n_vertices”]\norig : Int[jax.Array, “n_hes”]\ndest : Int[jax.Array, “n_hes”]\nnxt : Int[jax.Array, “n_hes”]\nprv : Int[jax.Array, “n_hes”]\ntwin : Int[jax.Array, “n_hes”]\nheface : Int[jax.Array, “n_hes”]\nface_incident : Int[jax.Array, “n_faces”]\ninf_vertices : tuple[Int]\nProperty methods (use like attributes)\nn_vertices : int\nn_hes : int\nn_faces : int\nn_items : tuple[int, int, int]\nfaces : Int[jax.Array, “n_faces 3”]\nhas_inf_vertex : bool\nis_inf_face : Bool[jax.Array, “n_faces”]\nis_unique : Bool[jax.Array, “n_hes”]\nis_inf_he : Bool[jax.Array, “n_hes”]\nis_bdry_he : Bool[jax.Array, “n_hes”]\nis_bdry_edge : Bool[jax.Array, “n_hes”]\nis_bdry : Bool[jax.Array, “n_vertices”]\nStatic methods\nfrom_triangles : tuple[int, Int[jax.Array, “n_faces 3”], Int[jax.Array, “n_boundaries”] -&gt; HeMesh\nClass methods\niterate_around_vertex : int -&gt; Int[jax.Array, “n_neighbors”]\nsave : str -&gt; None:\nStatic methods\nload : str -&gt; HeMesh\n\nmesh = TriMesh.read_obj(\"test_meshes/disk.obj\")\nhemesh = HeMesh.from_triangles(mesh.vertices.shape[0], mesh.faces)\n\nWarning: readOBJ() ignored non-comment line 3:\n  o flat_tri_ecmc\n\n\n\n# hemeshes can be compared for equali and are registered as py-trees\n\nleafs, ts = jax.tree_util.tree_flatten(hemesh)\n\nhemesh, hemesh == hemesh\n\n(HeMesh(N_V=131, N_HE=708, N_F=224), True)\n\n\n\n# test iteration around vertex\nhemesh.dest[hemesh.iterate_around_vertex(69)], hemesh.orig[hemesh.iterate_around_vertex(56)]\n\n(Array([80, 68, 56, 46], dtype=int64),\n Array([56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56], dtype=int64))\n\n\n\n# boundary in cc-wise order\n(hemesh.orig[187], hemesh.dest[187]), hemesh.heface[187], hemesh.is_bdry_he[187],\n\n((Array(58, dtype=int64), Array(70, dtype=int64)),\n Array(-1, dtype=int64),\n Array(True, dtype=bool))\n\n\n\nhemesh.is_bdry_he[187], hemesh.is_bdry_he[541], hemesh.heface[541]\n\n(Array(True, dtype=bool), Array(False, dtype=bool), Array(145, dtype=int64))\n\n\n\n# to model mesh boundaries, we can add an \"infinity\" vertex.

Boundary half-edges are assigned to a fictitious -1 face. This convention has a downside. It is not possible to modify the boundary loop of the mesh by edge flips - doing so would result in an invalid state. In a simulation, this artificially limits the mesh’s ability to deform. Instead, we can add “vertices at infinity” and connect al edges in a given boundary to \\(\\infty\\). This turns the mesh into a topological sphere. Now, one can flip boundary edges without the overall number of half-edges changing (so the array shape stays the same). Multiple boundaries are also supported. Each boundary corresponds to a distinct \\(\\infty\\)-vertex (for example, 2 for a cylinder)/\nThe coordinates of the fictitious vertices are set to [np.inf, np.inf] by convention.
